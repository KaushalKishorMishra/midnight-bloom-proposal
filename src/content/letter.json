    "My Dearest Nikita,",
    "If I could bottle up every moment I've spent thinking about you, I'd have an ocean — vast, deep, and endless. You've become the quiet melody that plays in my heart when the world goes silent.",
    "I don't know when it happened exactly — maybe it was the way you laugh, or how your eyes light up when you talk about things you love — but somewhere along the way, you became my favorite thought, my sweetest distraction, my most beautiful reason to smile.",
    "They say love is patient. Well, my love for you has been the most patient thing about me. It waited through the uncertainty, grew through the silence, and bloomed even when I wasn't sure you'd ever feel the same.",
    "I'm not perfect, Nikita. I'll forget things, I'll stumble over my words, and I'll probably annoy you sometimes. But I promise you this — no one will ever love you the way I do. With every fiber of my being, with every beat of this foolish, hopeful heart.",
    "You are my midnight bloom — rare, luminous, and worth every moment of waiting in the dark.",
    "Forever yours, no matter what."
